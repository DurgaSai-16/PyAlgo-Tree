### Script Name
Binary Search Tree.

### Aim
To write a program for Binary Search Tree.

### Purpose
To get a understanding about different operations performed in Binary Search Tree.
This program contains the menu-based implementation of the basic operations on a BST:
1. Insert Node into BST
2. Search Node in BST
3. Delete Node in BST
4. Print BST (inorder way)

### Short description of package/script
It is a python program of Binary Search Tree.
It is written in a way that it takes user input.

### Workflow of the Project
First the function are written to perform different operations in Binary Search Tree.
Then outside the function user input is taken.

### Detailed explanation of script, if needed
IMPLEMENTATION OF BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST)
Binary Search Tree is a special type of binary tree where:
1. The value of all the nodes in the left sub-tree is less than or equal to the value of the root.
2. The value of all the nodes in the right sub-tree is greater than value of the root.
3. This rule will be recursively applied to all the left and right sub-trees of the root.

### Setup instructions
Just clone the repository .
